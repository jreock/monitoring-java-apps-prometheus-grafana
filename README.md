# Monitoring Java Applications with Prometheus and Grafana Companion Files
Demo material from my talk entitled "Monitoring Java Applications with Prometheus and Grafana"  
[Download Slides](https://www.slideshare.net/JustinReock/monitoring-java-applicationswithprometheusandgrafanav10final)  

Note that these files are meant to be added to the stock, community distributions of the technologies in question.  For instance, the 'demo-config.yml' file contained in the alertmanager-0.18.0.darwin-amd64 directory is meant to be added to the root of your own instance of alertmanager v0.18.0 in order to follow along with the demos in the presentation.
